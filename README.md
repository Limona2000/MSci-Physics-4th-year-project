# MSci-Physics-4th-year-project
Hello! This is my MSci Physics project. 
To run these programs, you would need to download all trk files with overshooting and diffusion from Basti evolutionary tracks. 
The first bit of weighting part for Gaussian peaks was coded inefficiently, because something went wrong with the more efficient method, and I ran out of time to debug it. Since I basically learnt to code on this project, there are many possible improvements to this piece of code. I hope the future me will come back to improve it, without feeling nostalgic and sad for leaving physics.
